          Chicken
        </h2>
        <p>
          The healthiest way to cook chicken is to bake it in the oven or stir fry it with vegetables. Put the parts in a baking pan, rub some olive oil on them, and surround them with plenty of garlic, lemon, carrots, or whatever you like. Bake at 350Â° until brown.

        <p>
          Sushi is a very healthy meal! It's a good source of heart healthy omega-3 fatty acids thanks to the fish it's made with. Sushi is also low in calories as there's no added fat. The most common type is nigiri sushi made of fingers of sticky rice topped with a small fish.
